# CDC COM Port Single Example \(cdc\_com\_port\_single\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB Harmony USB Device Stack to<br /> support USB Communication Device Class. It demonstrates two-way communication between<br /> the USB device and the USB Host PC.

## **Description**

This application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a single COM port on the<br /> USB host PC. The COM port can be opened using any of the terminal applications. To<br /> demonstrate two-way communication, when a character is typed on the terminal window,<br /> it is echoed back by the USB device.

## **Running the Application**

This demonstration creates a USB device that enumerates as a serial \(COM\) port on the<br /> host. Do the following to run this demonstration:

<br />

1.  Open the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the target device.
2.  Attach the device to the host. If the host is a personal computer and this is the first time you have plugged this device into the computer you may be prompted for a .inf file. ![](GUID-129E4DA0-B63A-4E1E-808C-443876181CDB-low.png)
3.  Select the "Install from a list or specific location \(Advanced\)" option. Navigate to the driver path available in the repo - *..\\usb\_apps\_device\\apps\\cdc\_com\_port\_single\\inf*. ![](GUID-CD83B4FF-874B-4F31-90F4-14CC65A19F94-low.png)

    **Note:**

    <br />

    1.  Select the "Install from a list or specific location \(Advanced\)" option. Navigate to the driver path available in the repo - *..\\usb\_apps\_device\\apps\\cdc\_com\_port\_single\\inf*.
    2.  The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the device. Refer to the Configuring the Hardware section for the selected target hardware.
    <br />

4.  Once the device is successfully installed, open up a terminal program, such as HyperTerminal and select the appropriate COM port. Set the serial port settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 9600
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
5.  Once connected to the device, there are two ways to run this example project:
    -   Typing a key in the terminal window will result in the attached device echoing the next letter. Therefore, if the letter 'b' is pressed, the device will echo 'c'.
    -   If the push button is pressed, the device will echo "PUSH BUTTON PRESSED" to the terminal window. Refer to **Configuring the Hardware** section to identify the switch to be pressed for the selected target board.
