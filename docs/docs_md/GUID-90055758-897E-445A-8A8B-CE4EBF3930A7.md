<br />

|Name|Description|
|----|-----------|
|[CDC COM Port Dual](GUID-DC9141E3-DB3A-4237-B2B5-ECC8B29BFBCA.md)|The application is example of a USB CDC Device that<br /> enumerates as a dual COM port on the USB host PC. The COM port<br /> can be opened using any of the terminal applications. To<br /> demonstrate communication between the two COM ports, a character<br /> typed in one of the COM port is displayed on the other and vice<br /> versa.|
|[CDC COM Port Single](GUID-DB15E610-4438-4D75-A60F-9BC2079E65EC.md)|The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a<br /> single COM port on the USB host PC. The COM port can be opened<br /> using any of the terminal applications. To demonstrate two-way<br /> communication, when a character is typed on the terminal window,<br /> it is echoed back by the USB device.|
|[CDC MSD Basic](GUID-461D5868-A2B8-4F4F-B3E3-C866DE626629.md)|The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a<br /> COM port and Flash Drive simultaneously. The COM port can be<br /> opened using any of the terminal applications and to demonstrate<br /> two-way communication, a character typed on the terminal window<br /> is echoed back by the USB device. Flash drive acts similar to<br /> any Mass Storage Class device where the NVM is used as storage<br /> media.|
|[CDC MSD SD Card](GUID-8F76AB96-1C39-4752-BFB5-002111E06759.md)|The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a<br /> COM port and Flash Drive simultaneously. The COM port can be<br /> opened using any of the terminal applications and to demonstrate<br /> two-way communication, a character typed on the terminal window<br /> is echoed back by the USB device. Flash drive acts similar to<br /> any Mass Storage Class device where the SD Card is used as<br /> storage media.|

The application<br /> enumerates a COM port on the personal computer. Data received<br /> through the CDC USB interface is forwarded to a UART. Data<br /> received on the UART is forwarded to the CDC USB interface on<br /> the target board. The interface between the UART and the CDC USB<br /> Interface on the board demonstrates the USB to UART<br /> capability.|
|[CDC Serial Emulator MSD Example](GUID-FE4D3D9E-97F0-4013-9633-10979EC77570.md)|This application demonstrates a USB composite device with CDC<br /> and MSD functions. The CDC function implements a USB-to-Serial<br /> Converter. The MSD function driver implements a USB Mass Storage<br /> Device with NVM as storage media.|

|[HID Basic Remote Wakeup](GUID-0B7FFE15-B83E-4494-B418-0FF093E38D11.md)|This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB®<br /> Harmony USB Device Stack to support the Remote Wakeup feature<br /> using a custom HID device class example.|
|[HID Joystick](GUID-21956FBE-8E6E-4872-8A1C-3C3F89868BCD.md)|The application creates a custom HID joystick. The<br /> application is only intended to demonstrate creation of Joystick<br /> HID Report descriptors and may not be a definite end solution.<br /> The end application requirements may need the report descriptor<br /> to be modified.|
|[HID Keyboard](GUID-659FAABC-7E33-4359-B1D8-66E784DF9E43.md)|The application creates a Generic HID keyboard. Pressing a<br /> switch on the target board emulates a keyboard key<br /> press.|
|[HID Mouse](GUID-AC1353F8-AC36-4056-AFD7-B7AC4BC20ABA.md)|The application creates a USB HID based two-button mouse<br /> device.

The application enumerates<br /> two COM ports on the personal computer. Any data sent through<br /> the virtual COM ports will be seen at the respective UART port<br /> Tx pin and data sent through the UART Rx pin of the MCU will be<br /> seen at the virtual COM port.|
|[USB UART Bridge Single](GUID-2A54BC88-B3E1-4DA2-85DC-4A6739A4B0DB.md)|The application demonstrates the use of the CDC device class<br /> to implement a USB-UART bridge. The application enumerates a COM<br /> port on the personal computer. Any data sent through the virtual<br /> COM port will be seen at the respective UART port Tx pin and<br /> data sent through the UART Rx pin of the MCU will be seen at the<br /> virtual COM port.|
|[Vendor](GUID-3DAA29D1-4247-461D-A81C-17C442A1104B.md)|The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a<br /> custom vendor USB device on the USB host PC.
