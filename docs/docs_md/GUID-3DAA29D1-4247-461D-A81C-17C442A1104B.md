# Vendor Example \(vendor\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB Harmony USB Device Stack to<br /> support Vendor Device class.

## **Description**

This application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a custom vendor USB<br /> device on the USB host PC. The device uses USB Device Layer Endpoint functions and<br /> demonstrates the PC host's ability to control the LEDs on the board and query the<br /> status of a switch through PC utility.

## **Running the Application**

The Vendor device can be exercised by using the WinUSB PnP Demonstration<br /> application, which is provided in your installation of MPLAB Harmony.

The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the<br /> device. This application allows the state of the LEDs on the board to be toggled and<br /> indicates the state of a switch \(pressed/released\) on the board. Refer to the<br /> Configuring the Hardware section for the selected target hardware.

To launch the application, open the executable *WinUSB\_PnP\_Demo.exe*<br /> from the folder path<br /> *__usb\_apps\_device/apps/vendor/bin/WinUSB\_PnP\_Demo.exe__*. A dialog box<br /> similar to the following should appear:

![](GUID-B238D625-1CAC-4382-876F-DBCD544CE4BB-low.png)

The appropriate device family that is under testing should be selected in the<br /> utility. Pressing the Toggle LED button will cause the LED on the board to toggle.<br /> The Pushbutton State field in the application indicates the state of a button on<br /> connected USB Device. Pressing the switch on the development board will update the<br /> Pressed/Not Pressed status of the Pushbutton State field. **Note:** The device<br /> family under test should be selected appropriately. An incorrect selection will<br /> result in an invalid push button status. Windows Operating system may select a wrong<br /> driver by default. If the application does not run as expected it is suggested to<br /> look into the Windows Device Manager and see if the Microchip WinUSB Device is not<br /> shown with a Yellow mark. If so, the drivers should be selected manually from the<br /> application path.

## Manual selection of Drivers

To specifically select the driver, open the *device manager* and look<br /> for device named as **WinUSB Device** with a Yellow mark. Right click and select<br /> *Update Driver Software*. Select *Browse my computer for drivers*.<br /> Select the drivers in application path<br /> *..\\usb\_apps\_device\\apps\\vendor\\driver*.![](GUID-1676494E-B449-4E10-A320-8D6A42322817-low.png)
