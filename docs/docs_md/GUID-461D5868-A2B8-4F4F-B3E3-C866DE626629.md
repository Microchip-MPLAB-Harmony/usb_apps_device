# CDC MSD Basic Example \(cdc\_msd\_basic\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB Harmony USB Device Stack to<br /> support Composite USB Device

## **Description**

This application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a COM port and Flash<br /> Drive simultaneously. The COM port can be opened using any of the terminal<br /> applications and to demonstrate two-way communication, a character typed on the<br /> terminal window is echoed back by the USB device. Flash drive acts similar to any<br /> Mass Storage Class device where the NVM is used as storage media.

## **Configuring the Hardware**

**[SAME70 Xplained Ultra Board](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/DM320113)**

-   Jumper J203 must be shorted between PB08 and VBUS \(positions 2 and 3\).
-   Use TARGET USB J200 connector on the board to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED3 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press the switch SW400 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

**[Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103)**

-   Use the USB micro-B port J12 to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press the switch S1 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

**[Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320209)**

-   Use the USB micro-B port J201 to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press the switch SW1 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

**[SAME54 Xplained Pro Board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails/atsame54-xpro)**

-   Use TARGET USB connector on the board to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press the switch SW0 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

**[PIC32CZ CA80 Curiosity Ultra development board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea61x20a)**

-   Use TARGET USB connector \( J102 \) on the board to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press the switch SW0 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

**[PIC32CX SG41 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ev06x38a)**

-   Use TARGET USB connector \( J200 \) on the board to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.

-   Press the switch SW1 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

## **Running the Application**

This demonstration<br /> application creates a composite USB Device that works simultaneously as a CDC and as<br /> a MSD device. This application combines the functionality of the cdc\_com\_port\_single<br /> and msd\_basic demonstration applications into one device.

Open the<br /> project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the target<br /> device.

**Running the CDC Device**

The CDC Device application<br /> is same as *cdc\_com\_port\_single* demo. Refer to local documentation from [usb\_apps\_device/apps/cdc\_com\_port\_single](GUID-DB15E610-4438-4D75-A60F-9BC2079E65EC.md). The documentation is also<br /> available in the github path [usb\_apps\_device/apps/cdc\_com\_port\_single](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/tree/master/apps/cdc_com_port_single).

**Running the MSD Basic Device**

The MSD Basic Device application is same as *msd\_basic*<br /> demo. Refer to local documentation from [usb\_apps\_device/apps/msd\_basic](GUID-253EA897-AFA3-4A65-9976-EF08D2D362E8.md). The documentation is also available in<br /> the github path [usb\_apps\_device/apps/msd\_basic](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/tree/master/apps/msd_basic).
