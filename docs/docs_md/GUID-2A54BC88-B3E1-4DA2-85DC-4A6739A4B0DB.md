# USB UART Bridge Single Channel Example \(usb\_usart\_bridge\_single\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB® Harmony USB Device Stack to support<br /> the CDC Device Class using a real-world application. It implements a USB-USART Bridge<br /> application.

## **Description**

This application demonstrates the use of the CDC device class to implement a USB-UART<br /> bridge. The application enumerates as a COM port on the personal computer. Any data sent<br /> through the virtual COM port will be seen at the respective UART port Tx pin and data sent<br /> through the UART Rx pin of the MCU will be seen at the virtual COM port.

The following table gives the details of project configurations, target device<br /> used, hardware, and its IDE. Open the project using the respective IDE and build it.

|Project Name|IDE|Target Device|Hardware / Configuration|
|------------|---|-------------|------------------------|
|sam\_d21\_xpro.X|MPLABX|ATSAMD21J18A|SAM D21 Xplained Pro board|
|sam\_e54\_xpro.X|MPLABX|ATSAME54P20A|SAM E54 Xplained Pro Board|

## **Configuring the Hardware**

**[SAM D21 Xplained Pro board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/ProductDetails/atsamd21-xpro)**

-   Use the TARGET USB connector on the board to connect the USB device to the<br /> USB Host PC.

-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device<br /> functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).

-   Short the pins SERCOM1 USART TX \(PA16\) and SERCOM1 USART RX \(PA17\). These<br /> pins are available on the connector EXT2 pins 17 and 15 respectively.![](GUID-B06C58C7-E6DD-416F-BB40-503221D105C1-low.png)![](GUID-50DDAB0C-F61D-4DAE-93AE-54F4E941453B-low.png)


**[SAM E54 Xplained Pro Board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails/atsame54-xpro)**

-   Use the TARGET USB connector on the board to connect the USB device to the<br /> USB Host PC.

-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device<br /> functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).

-   Short the pins SERCOM0 USART TX \(PA04\) and SERCOM0 USART \(PA05\). These pins<br /> are available on the connector EXT1 pins 14 and 13 respectively.![](GUID-A139E224-3189-4CB4-8B13-79A8F0DE94D2-low.png)![](GUID-CF374684-5120-47A3-979B-C00F0D2AFFE1-low.png)


## **Running the Application**

This demonstration allows the device to appear like a serial \(COM\) port to the<br /> host. Do the following to run this demonstration:

1.  Open the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the<br /> target device.

2.  Attach the device to the host. If the host is a personal computer and this is<br /> the first time you have plugged this device into the computer, you may be prompted for a<br /> .inf file:![](GUID-95041821-ED67-4B5A-9A87-915B58C99DCD-low.png)

3.  Select the "Install from a list or specific location \(Advanced\)" option. Specify the *..\\usb\_apps\_device\\apps\\usb\_uart\_bridge\_single\\inf* directory.![](GUID-79E8AFE3-52DB-4121-AEF1-ACBBB3A6A716-low.png)![](GUID-4EE231EE-6C23-4E1C-A450-CF6AB49EBE14-low.png)![](GUID-9C161ED4-345E-478B-8DF9-13FE3F3D4619-low.png)
4.  Once the device is successfully installed, open an instance of a serial<br /> terminal program, such as HyperTerminal and select the appropriate COM port. Set the<br /> serial port settings as follows:

    -   Baud : 9600
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
    **Note:** The baud rate can different from 9600.![](GUID-241FFFEA-B0E5-4EA4-8404-3941CE371836-low.png)

5.  The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the device. Refer to the [Configuring the Hardware](https://file+.vscode-resource.vscode-cdn.net/c%3A/H3_USB_APPS/usb_apps_device/apps/usb_uart_bridge_single/readme.md#config_title) section for the selected board for more details.
6.  To run the demonstration, turn OFF the local echo on the serial terminal. For<br /> Tera Term terminal application, navigate to Setup-\>Terminal to turn OFF local echo. A<br /> character or string typed in the terminal window will be displayed on the same terminal<br /> as the Rx/Tx pins are shorted.![](GUID-8EF30034-44EE-4A06-B0C0-0DF974CBC3B2-low.png)
