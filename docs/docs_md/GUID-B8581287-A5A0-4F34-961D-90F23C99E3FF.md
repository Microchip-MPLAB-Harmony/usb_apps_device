# MSD Multiple LUN Example \(msd\_multiple\_luns\)

This application demonstrates data transfer between two storage media - SD card and<br /> non-volatile memory \(NVM\) - and a computer through USB Mass Storage Device \(MSD\).

## **Description**

This application demonstrates the creation of a USB device with multiple logical units. The<br /> storage media, SD Card, acts as one logical unit, and the NVM acts as the second logical<br /> unit. Data transfer between a computer and the logical units \(SD Card / NVM\) takes place<br /> through USB MSD.

## **Configuring the Hardware**

**[Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320209)**

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware is required:
    -   [micro-sd Click](https://www.mikroe.com/microsd-click) board
    -   micro-sd card
-   Insert the micro-sd click board into the Mikro BUS 1 connector on the Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board.
-   Insert the micro-SD card into the micro-SD Card slot of the micro-sd click board.
-   Use the USB micro-B port J201 to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).

**[Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103)**

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware is required:
    -   [micro-sd Click](https://www.mikroe.com/microsd-click) board
    -   micro-sd card
-   Insert the micro-sd click board into the Mikro BUS 1 connector on the Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board.
-   Insert the micro-SD card into the micro-SD Card slot of the micro-sd click board.
-   Ensure that a jumper is placed at 4-3 on J8, to select supply from debug USB connector.
-   USB micro-B port J12 to connect the USB device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).

**[PIC32CZ CA80 Curiosity Ultra development board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea61x20a)**

-   To run the demo, the following additional hardware is required:

-   Insert the micro-SD card into the micro-SD Card slot J600 of the PIC32CZ<br /> CA80 Curiosity Ultra development board.

-   Use the USB micro-B port J102 to connect the USB Device to the USB Host<br /> PC.

-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device<br /> functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).


## **Running the Application**

This demonstration uses SD card and NVM as drive storage media and shows them as<br /> two logical drives on the computer.

Connect the hardware platform to a computer through a USB cable. The device<br /> should appear as two new drives on the computer. The NVM media should appear as "Drive Name"<br /> and should have a sample â€œFILE.txtâ€? file. The drive name for the SD card media depends on<br /> the micro SD card vendor. The drives can then be used to store files. The LEDs on the<br /> demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the device. Refer to the Configuring the<br /> Hardware section for the selected target hardware.

Please note that the user should ensure that the Host is not currently writing<br /> data to the media before detaching the device. On a Windows computer before removing the<br /> device click on "Safely Remove Hardware" and click on "Eject Media".
