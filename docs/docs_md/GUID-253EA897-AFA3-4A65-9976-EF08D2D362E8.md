# MSD Basic Example \(msd\_basic\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB Harmony USB Device Stack to<br /> support USB Mass Storage Device. The application uses MCU's NVM region as storage<br /> media.

## **Description**

This application creates a USB MSD Device that enumerates as a Flash Drive on the USB<br /> host PC. The application allows read / write / modify / delete data from a PC host<br /> like any normal Flash drive.

## **Running the Application**

This demonstration uses the selected hardware platform as a logical drive<br /> on the computer using the internal Flash of the device as the drive storage<br /> media.

Connect the hardware platform to a computer through a USB cable. The device<br /> should appear as a new drive on the computer named "Drive Name". The drive can used<br /> to store files. The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of<br /> the device. Refer to the Configuring the Hardware section for the selected target<br /> hardware.

**Note:**

1.  The user should ensure that the Host is not currently writing data to the media before detaching the device. On a Windows computer before removing the device click on "Safely Remove Hardware" and click on "Eject Media".
2.  Reprogramming the development board will cause any stored files to be erased.
