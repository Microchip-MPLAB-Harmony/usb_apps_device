## **Configuring the Hardware**

**[Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320209)**

-   Use the USB micro-B port J201 to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   The CDC USB \(UART to USB\) interface on this board is served by the DEBUG\_USB connector J700. Connecting this to the PC will create a COM port on the PC Host.

**[SAME54 Xplained Pro Board](https://www.microchip.com/developmenttools/productdetails/atsame54-xpro)**

-   Use TARGET USB connector on the board to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   The CDC USB \(UART to USB\) interface on this board is served by the EDBG connector \(DEBUG\_USB\). Connecting this to the PC will create a COM port on the PC Host.

**[PIC32CZ CA80 Curiosity Ultra development board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea61x20a)**

-   Use the USB micro-B "USB DEVICE" connector \(J102\) to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   The CDC USB \(UART to USB\) interface on this board is served by the DEBUG\_USB connector. Connecting this to the PC will create a COM port on the PC Host.

**[SAM9X60-Curiosity Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV40E67A)**

-   Setup the SD card \(Note: exFAT formatted SD Cards are not supported\)
    -   Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/tree/master/deps/at91bootstrap_sam_9x60_binaries/boot.bin).
    -   Copy the downloaded boot loader binary \(boot.bin\) and generated application binary \(harmony.bin\) into the SD card.
    -   Insert the SD card into the SDMMC0 connector J3 on the board.
    -   Reset the board by pressing the Push Button "RESET".
-   Jumper J4 must be shorted.
-   Connect the USB Micro-B Connector \(J1\) on the board to the computer using a micro USB cable.
-   LED D1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(The USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   The demonstration uses an USB to serial cable to transfer demonstration application messages on a PC.![](GUID-D7C919FA-1F75-4514-AECB-6E73D0CFEE22-low.png)

**[SAM9X75-DDR3-EB Evaluation Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EA14J50A)**

-   Powered the board with an external power supply \(or use the micro AB<br /> connector\).

-   Setup the SD card \(Note: exFAT formatted SD Cards are not supported\)

    -   Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/tree/master/deps/at91bootstrap_sam_9x7_binaries/boot.bin).
    -   Copy the downloaded boot loader binary \(boot.bin\) and generated application binary \(harmony.bin\) into the SD card.
    -   Insert the SD card into the SDMMC connector \(SDMMC0\) on the board.
    -   Reset the board by pressing the Push Button RESET, then START.
-   Connect USB to serial cable to DBGU0 \(to enable debug com port\).

-   Connect the USB Micro-AB Connector on the board to the computer using a micro<br /> USB cable.

-   LED near VDDCORE inscription on the board indicates USB Device Configuration<br /> Set Complete event \(The USB device functionality has been activated by the USB<br /> Host\).

-   Press the switch USER to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB<br /> Host.

## **Running the Application**

Generic / Text Only driver simply outputs the data to the connected USB printer<br /> in raw format without performing any translation on the data to be printed.

There is no Printer head mechanism used in this demo, instead, the print data<br /> received from the host is sent to the serial terminal application running in the host itself<br /> by the demo application.![](GUID-5F98A09B-A002-4097-9B0F-F46991B9973A-low.png)

Once the device is successfully installed, open up a terminal program, such as<br /> HyperTerminal and select the appropriate COM port. Set the serial port settings as<br /> follows:

-   Baud : 115200

-   Data : 8 Bits

-   Parity : None

-   Stop : 1 Bit

-   Flow Control : None

    **Note:** Check the 'Device Manager' for the Virtual COM number associated<br /> with the EDBG.


## **Installing the printer**

The demo board attached to the host PC enumerates as *USB Printing Support* in Device<br /> Manager as shown below.

![](GUID-5AF1F052-779B-409F-84F5-72ECBD0264FC-low.png)

At this point, a new device by the name *Generic Text Printer Demo* should be<br /> available under Control Panel -\> Devices and Printers as shown below.

6.  In the printer name window, use the default name *Generic / Text Only* or provide any other name and click Next.![](GUID-4E0C1C63-97F9-4F85-B229-B01132B4CAFC-low.png)
7.  Click Finish to complete the Add printer wizard.![](GUID-C818E583-0913-4F7E-A625-1072DEE802D5-low.png)
8.  At this point, a new printer icon with the name provided in step \#6 should be visible under Devices and Printers window as shown below.![](GUID-98C02B83-5E2B-4851-8020-9643857F9530-low.png)

## **Print test page**

After successful installation of the *Generic / Text Only* printer, follow<br /> below steps to print a test page.

1.  On the printer icon, right click and select "Printer Properties"

2.  In the properties window, click "Print Test Page" as shown<br /> below.![](GUID-BC15D89F-ED1C-4281-8889-6FC69B6EEC32-low.png)![](GUID-2554B6A4-A45C-4305-9489-A725F7CCFBAE-low.png)

3.  Now the test page data will be printed on the serial terminal application as shown below. This shows the successful reception of print data sent by the host PC.![](GUID-19C0D7A0-2017-4398-B7B1-0377F4047CE5-low.png)
