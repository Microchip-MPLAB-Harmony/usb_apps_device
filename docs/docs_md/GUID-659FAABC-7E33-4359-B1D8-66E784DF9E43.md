## **Configuring the Hardware**

**[Curiosity PIC32MZ EF 2.0 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/DM320209)**

-   Use the USB micro-B port J201 to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press Switch SW1 to exercise the keyboard key press function.

**[Curiosity PIC32MX470 Development Board](https://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails/dm320103)**

-   Use the USB micro-B port J12 to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press the switch S1 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

**[PIC32CZ CA80 Curiosity Ultra development board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea61x20a)**

-   Use the USB micro-B "USB DEVICE" connector \(J102\) to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   Press the switch S1 to trigger communication from the USB Device to the USB Host.

**__[PIC32CX SG41 Curiosity Ultra Evaluation Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EV06X38A)__**

-   Use the USB micro-B "TARGET USB" connector \(J200\) to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED1 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).

## **Running the Application**

This demonstration uses the selected hardware platform as a USB keyboard. Open<br /> the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the target device.

The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the device, as<br /> described in the Configuring the Hardware section.

Before pressing the button, select a window in which it is safe to type text<br /> freely. Pressing the button on the demonstration board will cause the device to print a<br /> character on the screen. LED on the board will also indicate the current CapsLock key<br /> status.

**Note:** If the Caps lock status on the PC is OFF when the device was<br /> attached the LED will turn ON and immediately turn off.
