# CDC MSD SD Card Example \(cdc\_msd\_sdcard\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB Harmony USB Device Stack to<br /> support composite USB Device.

## **Description**

This application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a COM port and Flash<br /> Drive simultaneously. The COM port can be opened using any of the terminal<br /> applications. To demonstrate two-way communication, a character typed on the<br /> terminal window is echoed back by the USB device. Flash drive acts similar to any<br /> Mass Storage Class device where the SD Card is used as storage media.

## **Running the Application**

This demonstration<br /> application creates a composite USB Device that works simultaneously as a CDC and as<br /> a MSD device. This application combines the functionality of the cdc\_com\_port\_single<br /> and msd\_sdcard demonstration applications into one device.

Open the<br /> project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the target<br /> device.

**Running the CDC Device**

The CDC Device application<br /> is same as *cdc\_com\_port\_single* demo. Refer to local documentation from [usb\_apps\_device/apps/cdc\_com\_port\_single](GUID-DB15E610-4438-4D75-A60F-9BC2079E65EC.md). The documentation is also<br /> available in the github path [usb\_apps\_device/apps/cdc\_com\_port\_single](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/tree/master/apps/cdc_com_port_single).

**Running the MSD SD Card Device**

The MSD Basic Device application is same as *msd\_sdcard*<br /> demo. Refer to local documentation from [usb\_apps\_device/apps/msd\_sdcard](GUID-6CE28C84-CAF9-4BF9-9CC9-BD571C25AE48.md). The documentation is also available in<br /> the github path [usb\_apps\_device/apps/msd\_sdcard](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/tree/master/apps/msd_sdcard).
