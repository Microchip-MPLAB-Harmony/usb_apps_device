# HID Basic Example \(hid\_basic\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB Harmony USB Device Stack to support<br /> custom HID device class. This custom HID device can be controlled by a PC-based utility.

## **Description**

This application creates a USB HID Device that enumerates as a custom USB HID device on the<br /> USB host PC. The device allows the USB Host utility to control the LEDs on the board and<br /> query the status of a switch.

## **Running the Application**

This demonstration uses the selected hardware platform as a HID class USB device,<br /> but uses the HID class for general purpose I/O operations. Open the project with appropriate<br /> IDE. Compile the project and program the target device.

Typically, the HID class is used to implement human interface products, such as<br /> mice and keyboards. The HID protocol, is however, quite flexible, and can be adapted and<br /> used to send/receive general purpose data to/from a USB device. Using the HID class for<br /> general purpose I/O operations is quite advantageous, in that it does not require any kind<br /> of custom driver installation process. HID class drivers are already provided by and are<br /> distributed with common operating systems. Therefore, upon plugging in a HID class device<br /> into a typical computer system, no user installation of drivers is required, the<br /> installation is fully automatic.

The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the device as<br /> described in Configuring the Hardware section.

HID devices primarily communicate through one interrupt IN endpoint and one<br /> interrupt OUT endpoint. In most applications, this effectively limits the maximum achievable<br /> bandwidth for full speed HID devices to 64 kBytes/s of IN traffic, and 64 kBytes/s of OUT<br /> traffic \(64 kB/s, but effectively "full duplex"\).

The *GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe* program, and the associated firmware<br /> demonstrate how to use the HID protocol for basic general purpose USB data transfer.

Before you can run the *GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe* executable, you will need<br /> to have the Microsoft® .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package \(later versions<br /> are probably acceptable, but have not been tested\) installed on your computer. Programs that<br /> were built in the Visual Studio® .NET languages require the .NET redistributable package.<br /> The redistributable package can be freely downloaded from Microsoft’s website. Users of<br /> Windows Vista® operating systems will not need to install the .NET framework, as it comes<br /> preinstalled as part of the operating system.

## Launching the Application

To launch the application, open the executable *GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe*<br /> from the folder path<br /> *__usb\_apps\_device/apps/hid\_basic/bin/GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe__*. A UI similar to<br /> the following should appear

:![](GUID-B396825F-65DC-47C7-8E60-C0963C127A36-low.png)

Note: If instead of this window, an error message appears while trying to launch the application, it is likely the Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package has not yet been installed. Please install it and try again.

## **Send/Receive Packets**

To begin sending/receiving packets to the device, you must first find and connect<br /> to the device. As configured by default, the application is looking for HID class USB<br /> devices with VID = 0x04D8 and PID = 0x003F. The device descriptor in the firmware project<br /> meant to be used with this demonstration uses the same VID/PID. If you plug in a USB device<br /> programmed with the correct precompiled .hex file, and click **Connect**, the other push<br /> buttons should become enabled. If clicking **Connect** has no effect, it is likely the<br /> USB device is either not connected, or has not been programmed with the correct<br /> firmware.

Clicking **Toggle LED\(s\)** should send a single packet of general purpose<br /> generic data to the HID class USB peripheral device. The data will arrive on the interrupt<br /> OUT endpoint. The firmware has been configured to receive this generic data packet, parse<br /> the packet looking for the Toggle LED\(s\) command, and should respond appropriately by<br /> controlling the LED\(s\) on the demonstration board.

The Get Pushbutton State option will send one packet of data over the USB to the<br /> peripheral device \(to the interrupt OUT endpoint\) requesting the current push button state.<br /> The firmware will process the received Get Pushbutton State command, and will prepare an<br /> appropriate response packet depending upon the pushbutton state.

Refer to the Configuring the Hardware section for details on the LED indication<br /> and Switch, that are relevant to the selected hardware.
