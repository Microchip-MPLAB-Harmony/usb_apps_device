# CDC Serial Emulator Example \(cdc\_serial\_emulator\)

This application demonstrates the ability of the MPLAB Harmony USB Device Stack to support<br /> CDC Device Class using a real-world application. It implements a CDC USART Serial Emulator<br /> application.

## **Description**

This application demonstrates the use of the CDC device class to implement a USB-to-Serial<br /> Converter. TThe application enumerates a COM port on the personal computer. Data received<br /> through the CDC USB interface is forwarded to a UART. Data received on the UART is forwarded<br /> to the CDC USB interface on the target board. The interface between the UART and the CDC USB<br /> Interface on the board demonstrates the USB to UART capability.

-   The CDC USB \(UART to USB\) interface on this board is served by the DEBUG\_USB connector J700. Connecting this to the PC will create a COM port on the PC Host.

**[PIC32CZ CA80 Curiosity Ultra development board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/ea61x20a)**

-   Use the USB micro-B "USB DEVICE" connector \(J102\) to connect the USB Device to the USB Host PC.
-   LED0 indicates USB Device Configuration Set Complete event \(the USB device functionality has been activated by the USB Host\).
-   The CDC USB \(UART to USB\) interface on this board is served by the DEBUG\_USB connector. Connecting this to the PC will create a COM port on the PC Host.

**[SAM9X75-DDR3-EB Evaluation Board](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/development-tool/EA14J50A)**

-   Powered the board with an external power supply \(or use the micro AB<br /> connector\).

-   Setup the SD card \(Note: exFAT formatted SD Cards are not supported\)

    -   Download harmony MPU bootstrap loader from this [location](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/tree/master/deps/at91bootstrap_sam_9x7_binaries/boot.bin).
    -   Copy the downloaded boot loader binary \(boot.bin\) and generated application binary \(harmony.bin\) into the SD card.
    -   Insert the SD card into the SDMMC connector \(SDMMC0\) on the board.
    -   Reset the board by pressing the Push Button RESET, then START.
-   Connect USB to serial cable to DBGU0 \(to enable debug com port\).

## **Running the Application**

This application demonstrates the use of the CDC Device class in implementing a<br /> USB-to-Serial Converter. The application enumerates a COM port on the USB Host PC. Data<br /> received through the CDC USB interface is forwarded to a UART. Data received on the UART is<br /> forwarded to the CDC USB interface. This emulates a USB-to-Serial Converter.

1.  Open the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the<br /> target device.

2.  Attach the device to the host. If the host is a personal computer and this is<br /> the first time you have plugged this device into the computer you may be prompted for a<br /> .inf file.

3.  Select the "Install from a list or specific location \(Advanced\)" option. Navigate to the driver path available in the repo - *..\\usb\_apps\_device\\apps\\cdc\_serial\_emulator\\inf*.![](GUID-1AEE7A91-FE79-4D95-8D8A-D48F80B56A33-low.png)NOTE: The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the device. Refer to the Configuring the Hardware section for the selected target hardware.
4.  Once the device is successfully installed and visible on the *Device Manager*, open up a terminal program, such as HyperTerminal and select the appropriate COM port. This is terminal 1. Set the serial port settings as follows:
    -   Baud : 9600
    -   Data : 8 Bits
    -   Parity : None
    -   Stop : 1 Bit
    -   Flow Control : None
5.  Connect the CDC USB port to the Host PC and ensure that a second COM port is available on the Host PC. Refer to the Configuring the Hardware section for more details. Open a serial terminal program and select the second COM port. The serial settings of this COM port should match the setting made in *previous step*. This is terminal 2. The setup should resemble the below figure.![](GUID-10FC6999-5476-421F-9A62-C54B3A8BB76E-low.png)
6.  To run the demonstration, turn on local echo on both the terminals. If the terminal application is Tera Term, navigate to Setup-\>Terminal to turn on local echo. Type a character or string in one terminal window. The same character or string shall appear on the second terminal window and vice versa. The following screen shot shows two instances of Tera Term.![](GUID-295DA2D2-68C5-4D76-898E-CBDA03900F8E-low.png)Note: Some terminal programs, like HyperTerminal, require users to click the disconnect button before removing the device from the computer. Failing to do so may result in having to close and open the program again to reconnect to the device.
