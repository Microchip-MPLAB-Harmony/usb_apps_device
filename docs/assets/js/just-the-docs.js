    "content": "This demonstration uses the selected hardware platform as a HID class USB device, but uses the HID class for general purpose I/O operations. Open the project with appropriate IDE. Compile the project and program the target device. Typically, the HID class is used to implement human interface products, such as mice and keyboards. The HID protocol, is however, quite flexible, and can be adapted and used to send/receive general purpose data to/from a USB device. Using the HID class for general purpose I/O operations is quite advantageous, in that it does not require any kind of custom driver installation process. HID class drivers are already provided by and are distributed with common operating systems. Therefore, upon plugging in a HID class device into a typical computer system, no user installation of drivers is required, the installation is fully automatic. The LEDs on the demonstration board will indicate the USB state of the device as described in Configuring the Hardware section. HID devices primarily communicate through one interrupt IN endpoint and one interrupt OUT endpoint. In most applications, this effectively limits the maximum achievable bandwidth for full speed HID devices to 64 kBytes/s of IN traffic, and 64 kBytes/s of OUT traffic (64 kB/s, but effectively “full duplex”). The GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe program, and the associated firmware demonstrate how to use the HID protocol for basic general purpose USB data transfer. Before you can run the GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe executable, you will need to have the Microsoft® .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package (later versions are probably acceptable, but have not been tested) installed on your computer. Programs that were built in the Visual Studio® .NET languages require the .NET redistributable package. The redistributable package can be freely downloaded from Microsoft’s website. Users of Windows Vista® operating systems will not need to install the .NET framework, as it comes preinstalled as part of the operating system. Launching the Application . To launch the application, open the executable GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe from the folder path usb_apps_device/apps/hid_basic/bin/GenericHIDSimpleDemo.exe. A UI similar to the following should appear: . Note: If instead of this window, an error message appears while trying to launch the application, it is likely the Microsoft .NET Framework Version 2.0 Redistributable Package has not yet been installed. Please install it and try again. Send/Receive Packets . To begin sending/receiving packets to the device, you must first find and connect to the device. As configured by default, the application is looking for HID class USB devices with VID = 0x04D8 and PID = 0x003F. The device descriptor in the firmware project meant to be used with this demonstration uses the same VID/PID. If you plug in a USB device programmed with the correct precompiled .hex file, and click Connect, the other push buttons should become enabled. If clicking Connect has no effect, it is likely the USB device is either not connected, or has not been programmed with the correct firmware. Clicking Toggle LED(s) should send a single packet of general purpose generic data to the HID class USB peripheral device. The data will arrive on the interrupt OUT endpoint. The firmware has been configured to receive this generic data packet, parse the packet looking for the Toggle LED(s) command, and should respond appropriately by controlling the LED(s) on the demonstration board. The Get Pushbutton State option will send one packet of data over the USB to the peripheral device (to the interrupt OUT endpoint) requesting the current push button state. The firmware will process the received Get Pushbutton State command, and will prepare an appropriate response packet depending upon the pushbutton state. Refer to the Configuring the Hardware section for details on the LED indication and Switch, that are relevant to the selected hardware. ",

The COM port can be opened using any of the terminal applications. To demonstrate communication between the two COM ports, a character typed in one of the COM port is displayed on the other and vice versa. | CDC COM Port Single | The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a single COM port on the USB host PC. The COM port can be opened using any of the terminal applications. To demonstrate two-way communication, when a character is typed on the terminal window, it is echoed back by the USB device. | CDC MSD Basic | The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a COM port and Flash Drive simultaneously. The COM port can be opened using any of the terminal applications and to demonstrate two-way communication, a character typed on the terminal window is echoed back by the USB device. Flash drive acts similar to any Mass Storage Class device where the NVM is used as storage media. | CDC MSD SD Card | The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a COM port and Flash Drive simultaneously. The COM port can be opened using any of the terminal applications and to demonstrate two-way communication, a character typed on the terminal window is echoed back by the USB device. Flash drive acts similar to any Mass Storage Class device where the SD Card is used as storage media. | CDC Serial Emulator | The application demonstrates the use of the CDC device class to implement a USB-to-Serial Converter. TThe application enumerates a COM port on the personal computer. Data received through the CDC USB interface is forwarded to a UART. Data received on the UART is forwarded to the CDC USB interface on the target board. The interface between the UART and the CDC USB Interface on the board demonstrates the USB to UART capability. | HID Basic | The application creates a USB HID Device that enumerates as a custom USB HID device on the USB host PC. The device allows the USB Host utility to control the LEDs on the board and query the status of a switch. | HID Joystick | The application creates a custom HID joystick. The application is only intended to demonstrate creation of Joystick HID Report descriptors and may not be a definite end solution. The end application requirements may need the report descriptor to be modified. | HID Keyboard | The application creates a Generic HID keyboard. Pressing a switch on the target board emulates a keyboard key press. | HID Mouse | The application creates a USB HID based two-button mouse device. When connected, the device emulates mouse operation by moving the cursor in a circular pattern. When the button in USB device is pressed the movement of cursor is Stopped/Started again. | HID MSD Basic | The application creates a USB Device that combines the functionality of the hid_basic and msd_basic demonstration applications. To demonstrate HID functionality, the device allows USB Host utility to control the LEDs on the board and query the status of a switch. To demonstrate MSD functionality, application allows read / write / modify / delete data from a PC host like any normal Flash drive. | MSD Basic | The application creates a USB MSD Device that enumerates as a Flash Drive on the USB host PC. The application allows read / write / modify / delete data from a PC host like any normal Flash drive. | MSD SD Card | The application creates a USB MSD Device that enumerates as a Flash Drive on the USB host PC. The application allows read / write / modify / delete data from a PC host like any normal Flash drive. | Printer | This demo uses PC running Windows 7 as a USB Host. The demo board programmed with the demo application, enumerates as \\\"USB Printing Support\\\" device when connected to the USB Host. This demo allows the user to print the text from Notepad or similar application in Windows using built in **Generic/Text Only** print driver. | USB UART Bridge Dual | The application demonstrates the use of the CDC device class to implement a dual USB-UART bridge. The application enumerates two COM ports on the personal computer. Any data sent through the virtual COM ports will be seen at the respective UART port Tx pin and data sent through the UART Rx pin of the MCU will be seen at the virtual COM port. | Vendor | The application creates a USB CDC Device that enumerates as a custom vendor USB device on the USB host PC. The device uses USB Device Layer Endpoint functions and demonstrates the PC host's ability to control the LEDs on the board and query the status of a switch through PC utility. | ____ [![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Harmony%20license-orange.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/blob/master/mplab_harmony_license.md) [![Latest release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/releases/latest) [![Latest release date](https://img.shields.io/github/release-date/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/releases/latest) [![Commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/y/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device.svg)](https://github.com/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device/graphs/commit-activity) [![Contributors](https://img.shields.io/github/contributors-anon/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device.svg)]() ____ [![Follow us on Youtube](https://img.shields.io/badge/Youtube-Follow%20us%20on%20Youtube-red.svg)](https://www.youtube.com/user/MicrochipTechnology) [![Follow us on LinkedIn](https://img.shields.io/badge/LinkedIn-Follow%20us%20on%20LinkedIn-blue.svg)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/microchip-technology) [![Follow us on Facebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Facebook-Follow%20us%20on%20Facebook-blue.svg)](https://www.facebook.com/microchiptechnology/) [![Follow us on Twitter](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/MicrochipTech.svg?style=social)](https://twitter.com/MicrochipTech) [![](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device.svg?style=social)]() [![](https://img.shields.io/github/watchers/Microchip-MPLAB-Harmony/usb_apps_device.svg?style=social)]() ",
